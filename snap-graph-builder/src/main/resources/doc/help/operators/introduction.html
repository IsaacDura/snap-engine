<h3>Graphs</h3>

<p>Graph Processing is used to apply operations to the data to
    allow&nbsp;you to create your own processing chains.</p>

<p class="Paranum" style="">A graph is a set
    of nodes connected by edges. &nbsp;In this
    case, the nodes will be the processing steps. &nbsp;The edges will
    show the direction in which the
    data is being passed between nodes; therefore it will be a directed
    graph.
    &nbsp;The
    graph will have no loops or cycles, so it will be a Directed Acyclic
    Graph (DAG).</p>

<p class="Paranum" style="">The sources of the
    graph will be the data
    product readers, and the sinks can be either a
    product writer or an image displayed on the DAT.<br>
</p>

<p class="Paranum" style="">The GPF uses a
    Pull Model,
    wherein a request is made from the sink backwards to the source to
    process the
    graph. This
    request could be to create a new product file or to update a displayed
    image. &nbsp;Once the request reaches a
    source, the image is pulled through the nodes to the sink.
    &nbsp;Each time an image passes
    through an operator, the operator transforms the image, and it is
    passed
    down to the next node until it reaches the sink.</p>

<p class="Paranum" style="">The graph processor
    will not introduce any intermediate
    files unless a writer is optionally added anywhere in the sequence</p>

<h3 style="margin-left: 0in;"><a name="_Toc191202382">Tiling</a></h3>

<p class="Paranum" style="">The memory
    management&nbsp;allows&nbsp;very large data products
    that can
    not be all stored in available memory, to be handled by the processing
    tools and visualization. &nbsp;To
    do so, a tiled approach is used. </p>

<p class="Paranum" style="">The
    dataset is divided into workable areas called tiles consisting of a
    subset
    of the data read from disk in one piece. &nbsp;Only the data for
    tiles being visualized is read in, and in some cases the data
    could be down-sampled to view the desired area at the expense of
    resolution. </p>

<p class="Paranum" style="">Depending
    on the tool, data is ingested for a tile or a set of tiles, and
    processing is applied only to the current set of tiles. &nbsp;The
    data
    is then&nbsp;written to a file and
    released from memory. &nbsp;The process is
    then&nbsp;repeated on a new set of tiled data from the large data
    product.</p>

<p class="Paranum" style="">From the
    DAT, in order to allow zooming out and viewing of the entire image, a
    pyramid
    of tiled images at different resolutions is used. Tiling is generally
    transparent to the user.</p>

<h3 style="margin-left: 0in;"><a name="_Toc191202383">Operators</a></h3>

<p class="Paranum" style="">In order to provide the
    greatest flexibility to the end user, processing algorithms such as
    orthorectification and co-registration are broken down into unit
    processing
    steps called Operators. These operators may
    be
    reused to create new processing graphs
    for other purposes.</p>
<br>

<p>The Toolbox includes various processing modules that could be
    run either from
    the DAT GUI or from the command line such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data Conversion</li>
    <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Band Arithmetic</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Image Filtering</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistics
        &amp; Data Analysis
    </li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ellipsoid Correction</li>
    <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Terrain Correction</li>
    <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Co-Registration</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reprojection</li>
    <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Subset</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calibration</li>
    <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Multilooking</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apply Orbit Correction</li>
    <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Create Stack</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Create Elevation</li>
    <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Resampling</li>
    <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Interferometry</li>
    <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Plus many more</li>
</ul>
