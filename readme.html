<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>The S3TBX software is a set of executable tools and an application
    programming interface (API) facilitating the use
    of the data products of a number of earth observation satellites.
    Its main purpose is to support the data of the OLCI and SLSTR sensors onboard the ESA Sentinel-3 platform.
    S3TBX is developed under contract to <a href="http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/ESRIN_SITE/">ESA/ESRIN</a>.</p>

    <li><code><a href="config">config</a></code> - S3TBX configuration file.</li>
    <li><code><a href="lib">lib</a></code> - Common libraries used by S3TBX.</li>
